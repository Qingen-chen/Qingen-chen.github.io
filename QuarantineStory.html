    <p>I havenâ€™t been out for a long time since I started online class. Many times my food is basically called delivery, and now my clothes are basically pajamas.</p>

    <p>Oranges are my favorite fruit, so this time I bought a box and put it at home.</p>

    <p>We see a lot more animals out on our walks.</p>

    <p>A lot of days after working I take a walk up to the airport. The totally empty runway at one of the most crowded airports in the country contextualizes the seriousness of this situation. It seems like the city I once knew will never quite be the same again.</p>
